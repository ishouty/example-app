# Atomic Design Pattern in React Components

## Overview

The **Atomic Design Pattern** is a methodology for creating design systems and UI components. It promotes a structured approach to component development, allowing for better scalability, maintainability, and consistency across applications. This README outlines the principles of Atomic Design and provides guidance on how to implement it in your React projects.

## What is Atomic Design?

Atomic Design is a methodology developed by Brad Frost that divides the UI into five distinct levels: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Pages. This approach encourages developers and designers to think in terms of reusable components, leading to a more organized and efficient workflow.

## The Five Levels of Atomic Design

### Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of all matter and, in the context of UI, represent the smallest components of a design system. Examples of atoms include:

- Buttons
- Input fields
- Labels
- Icons

These components are typically stateless and can be styled using CSS or styled-components in React.

**Example:**

```jsx
// Button.js
const Button = ({ label, onClick }) => (
  <button className="btn" onClick={onClick}>
    {label}
  </button>
);
```
