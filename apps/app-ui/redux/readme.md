## What is Redux Toolkit?

Redux Toolkit is a library that helps you write Redux logic in a more efficient and concise way. It includes utilities to simplify store setup, reduce boilerplate code, and provide common patterns for handling state management. Redux Toolkit is particularly helpful for new users as it abstracts away some of the complexities associated with Redux.

## Key Features of Redux Toolkit

- **Simplified Store Setup**: Easily configure the Redux store with a simple function.
- **Batteries Included**: Comes with useful tools like `createSlice`, `createAsyncThunk`, and more.
- **Automatic Action Types and Action Creators**: Automatically generates action types and action creators for you.
- **Immutable State Updates**: Uses the `immer` library under the hood to handle immutable state updates seamlessly.
- **DevTools Support**: Built-in support for Redux DevTools for debugging your application state.

## Getting Started

To get started with Redux Toolkit in your React project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Redux Toolkit and React-Redux**:

   ```bash
   npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
